#How it works:
#When you press a key, it writes to log.txt.
#Regular characters (a, b, 1, etc.) are logged as-is.
#Special keys (like Enter, Space, Shift) are logged in square brackets.
#Pressing Esc will stop the script cleanly.
#⚠️ Important Notes:
#This should only be run in a controlled/testing environment (like your own machine in a test folder).

#Do not use this on someone else’s computer or without explicit permission — that would be illegal.
